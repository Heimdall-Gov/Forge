# Product Requirements Document: AI Governance Framework Generator

# Executive Summary

The AI Governance Framework Generator is an open-source tool designed to help organizations implement appropriate AI governance practices. The tool collects information about a user's AI project or company through a series of targeted questions, then leverages a RAG-based system to generate customized AI governance frameworks and compliance checklists tailored to their specific needs.

# Problem Statement

Organizations developing or deploying AI systems face increasing regulatory requirements and ethical considerations. Many lack the expertise to develop comprehensive governance frameworks that address their specific AI use cases. Existing frameworks are often generic, difficult to implement, or require specialized knowledge to adapt.

## User Needs

Organizations need guidance on which AI governance practices apply to their specific use cases

Teams need practical, actionable checklists for implementing governance measures

Users need to understand regulatory requirements without specialized legal expertise

Organizations need help adapting existing frameworks to their specific context

# Solution Overview

Our AI Governance Framework Generator will:

Collect relevant information about the user's AI project or organization through a structured questionnaire

Use a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to access a comprehensive database of AI governance frameworks and best practices

Generate customized governance recommendations and implementation checklists based on the user's responses

Provide explanations and context for recommended practices

# Target Users

Primary: AI project managers, compliance officers, and technical leads responsible for implementing AI governance

Secondary: Executives and decision-makers evaluating AI governance needs

Tertiary: Researchers and policymakers studying AI governance implementation

# User Experience

## Input Process

Users will answer a series of questions about their:

Organization type and size

Industry and regulatory environment

AI use cases and applications

Data sources and types

Deployment context

Existing governance measures

The interface will adapt questions based on previous answers to ensure relevance

Users can save progress and return to complete the questionnaire

## Output

Executive summary

Governance structure recommendations

Risk assessment methodology

Documentation requirements

Testing and validation procedures

Monitoring and maintenance guidelines

Implementation checklists organized by:

Project phase (design, development, deployment, monitoring)

Responsible role (technical team, legal, management)

Priority level

References to source frameworks and regulatory requirements

# Open Questions & Risks

## Open Questions

How to balance comprehensiveness with usability?

How to handle conflicting recommendations from different frameworks?

How to verify the quality and accuracy of generated frameworks?

How to keep the framework database current with evolving regulations?

## Risks

Quality risk: Generated frameworks may not address all relevant concerns

Regulatory risk: Users may over-rely on tool recommendations without expert review

Data risk: Incomplete or outdated framework database could lead to gaps

Usability risk: Complex questionnaire may lead to user abandonment

# Next Steps

Create initial framework database structure

Develop questionnaire prototype

Seek input from AI governance experts

Define contribution guidelines for the open source community
