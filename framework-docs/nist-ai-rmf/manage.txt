# NIST AI Risk Management Framework - MANAGE Function
# Target: ~10,000 tokens
# TODO: Add full text from official NIST AI RMF 1.0

# The MANAGE function entails allocating risk resources to mapped and measured risks on a regular basis and as defined by the GOVERN function.

# PLACEHOLDER CONTENT FOR DEVELOPMENT
# This is a simplified version for testing purposes

MANAGE FUNCTION OVERVIEW:
The MANAGE function involves:
- Responding to identified risks
- Allocating resources for risk mitigation
- Implementing controls and safeguards
- Planning for incidents and failures
- Continuously improving risk management

MANAGE.1: RISK RESPONSE
MANAGE.1.1: Risk response plans are implemented.
- Response strategies are defined
- Actions are prioritized
- Resources are allocated
- Timelines are established
- Responsibilities are assigned

MANAGE.1.2: Risks are monitored and mitigated on an ongoing basis.
- Continuous monitoring occurs
- Mitigation effectiveness is assessed
- Adjustments are made as needed
- New risks are addressed
- Risk levels are tracked

MANAGE.1.3: Risk treatments, including response and recovery, are documented and demonstrated.
- Treatment approaches are recorded
- Response procedures are documented
- Recovery plans are established
- Demonstrations of effectiveness exist
- Lessons learned are captured

MANAGE.1.4: Negative residual risks of AI systems are managed.
- Residual risks are identified
- Acceptance decisions are documented
- Additional controls are considered
- Monitoring of residual risks occurs
- Communication of residual risks is clear

MANAGE.2: INCIDENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY
MANAGE.2.1: Procedures are followed to respond to and recover from a previously unknown risk when it is identified.
- Incident response plans exist
- Unknown risk protocols are defined
- Response teams are prepared
- Recovery procedures are documented
- Post-incident reviews occur

MANAGE.2.2: Mechanisms are in place and applied to sustain the value of deployed AI systems.
- Value monitoring occurs
- Maintenance procedures exist
- Updates are managed
- Performance is sustained
- Degradation is addressed

MANAGE.2.3: Incidents and errors are communicated to relevant personnel and stakeholders.
- Communication protocols exist
- Stakeholders are notified
- Transparency is maintained
- Timely communication occurs
- Appropriate detail is provided

MANAGE.2.4: Organizational practices and procedures for AI system decommissioning are established and documented.
- Decommissioning plans exist
- Data retention is addressed
- System retirement is managed
- Stakeholder communication occurs
- Knowledge transfer is ensured

MANAGE.3: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
MANAGE.3.1: AI risks and trustworthiness issues are regularly monitored and evaluated.
- Regular assessments occur
- Issues are tracked
- Trends are analyzed
- Emerging risks are identified
- Trustworthiness is monitored

MANAGE.3.2: Feedback from those external to the organization about trust, trustworthiness, and responsible AI is appropriately integrated into AI risk management.
- External feedback is collected
- Stakeholder input is valued
- Integration processes exist
- Improvements are made
- Communication is bidirectional

MANAGE.3.3: Lessons learned from incidents and continuous monitoring are incorporated into organizational policies and practices.
- Incident reviews occur
- Root causes are identified
- Lessons are documented
- Policies are updated
- Practices are improved

MANAGE.4: GOVERNANCE INTEGRATION
MANAGE.4.1: AI risk management is integrated into organization-wide risk management processes.
- Integration is systematic
- Coordination occurs
- Reporting is unified
- Risk aggregation happens
- Enterprise view is maintained

MANAGE.4.2: Oversight structures are in place to govern AI risk management decisions.
- Governance bodies exist
- Authority is clear
- Decision processes are defined
- Accountability is established
- Reviews are regular

MANAGE.4.3: AI system risks are prioritized based on likelihood and impact assessments, organizational risk tolerance, and organizational policies.
- Prioritization framework exists
- Risk rankings are established
- Resource allocation reflects priorities
- Risk tolerance guides decisions
- Regular reprioritization occurs

MANAGE.5: DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSPARENCY
MANAGE.5.1: AI system documentation is kept up to date.
- Documentation maintenance occurs
- Updates are systematic
- Version control is used
- Currency is ensured
- Access is managed

MANAGE.5.2: Mechanisms for stakeholders to access and provide feedback on AI system documentation are established.
- Access mechanisms exist
- Feedback channels are open
- Stakeholder input is valued
- Documentation improves
- Transparency is promoted

MANAGE.5.3: Risk treatments and any updates to them are documented and communicated to relevant personnel and stakeholders.
- Treatment documentation exists
- Updates are tracked
- Communication is clear
- Stakeholders are informed
- Records are maintained

MANAGE.6: RESOURCE ALLOCATION
MANAGE.6.1: Resources are allocated to address identified AI risks based on risk priorities.
- Budget allocation occurs
- Personnel are assigned
- Tools are provided
- Time is allocated
- Priorities drive allocation

MANAGE.6.2: Ongoing monitoring and periodic review of resource allocation for AI risk management are conducted.
- Allocation effectiveness is assessed
- Adjustments are made
- Gaps are identified
- Reallocation occurs as needed
- Efficiency is monitored
