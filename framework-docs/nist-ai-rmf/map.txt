MAP FUNCTION OVERVIEW:
The MAP function establishes the context for understanding risks associated with AI systems. This function helps organizations:
- Understand the AI system's context of use
- Identify potential impacts and harms
- Categorize AI systems based on risk
- Establish the foundation for risk assessment

MAP.1: CONTEXT
MAP.1.1: Intended purposes, potentially beneficial uses, context-specific laws, norms, and expectations, and prospective settings in which the AI system will be deployed are understood and documented.
- Intended use cases are clearly defined
- Beneficial applications are identified
- Legal and regulatory context is understood
- Expected deployment environments are documented
- Stakeholder expectations are captured

MAP.1.2: Interdependencies and associated risks among AI system components, systems, and infrastructure are understood and documented.
- System dependencies are mapped
- Integration points are identified
- Infrastructure requirements are documented

MAP.3.4: Feedback processes for end users and impacted communities to report problems and appeal system outcomes are established.
- Reporting mechanisms are created
- Appeal processes are defined
- Feedback channels are established
- Response procedures are documented
- Remediation processes are planned

MAP.3.5: Organizational risk tolerances and potential benefits are weighed against the severity and likelihood of potential harms, and informed by diverse perspectives.
- Risk-benefit analysis is conducted
